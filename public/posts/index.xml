      <description>Welcome to the new Riptide site!
After taking a short break from playing shows, we are back! We&amp;rsquo;ve now updated our social media sites and created this brand new website to keep you all up to date with all of the latest and greatest going on with the band.
This site is going to be a work in progress so feel free to let us know via our Contact Form if you would like to book a show, request an improvement with the site, or even Request a Song.</description>
